Predicting optimum number of clusters

## OBJECTIVE-Clustering of Iris Dataset

From the ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

## K Means Algorithm

Kmeans algorithm is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into Kpre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group.

## Workflow behind Implemention of K-Means Clustering

1.Choose the number of clusters k

2.Select k random points from the data as centroids

3.Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid

4.Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters

5.Repeat steps 3 and 4
